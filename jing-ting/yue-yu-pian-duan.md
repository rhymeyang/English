Luck for you, I got some <mark style="color:orange;">**pull**</mark> around here. I can make this sort of thing go away, like it never happened. That's good. Now... I'm sure you've heard the word "<mark style="color:orange;">**rat**</mark>", I don't like it. "<mark style="color:orange;">**Snitch**</mark>", neither. Those sort of words aren't appropriate for what I need from you. What I need is a little information. Like when you're hanging out with Scofield ... Just come back and tell me what he said.  &#x20;
